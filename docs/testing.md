# Testing EUVCRAFT

## Toolchain

NeoForge 26.3 targets the Java 25 runtime that Mojang ships with Minecraft 26.3.
`build.gradle` pins this with a Gradle Java toolchain:

```groovy
java.toolchain.languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(25)
```

Gradle's Foojay resolver (configured in `settings.gradle`) provisions that JDK, so
builds do not depend on `JAVA_HOME`. Documented commands below assume a normal
shell with no `JAVA_HOME` override.

## Unit tests (JUnit 5)

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test --offline
.\gradlew.bat checkCoreImports --offline
```

ModDevGradle unit test support is enabled in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
neoForge {
    unitTest {
        enable()
    }
}
```

The `FabConfig` mc test verifies that the NeoForge config spec builds and its
defaults equal `FabSettings.defaults()`.

Per-class counts are in `build/test-results/test/*.xml`.

## Game tests

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat runGameTestServer --offline
```

A trivial game test is registered as `lithmod:trivial` and must report as passed.

The fab randomness game tests are `lithmod:fab_random_salt_round_trip` (the salt is
written to `<world>/dimensions/minecraft/overworld/data/lithmod/fab_random.dat` and
replaying the same context after reading that file back yields the same rolls) and
`lithmod:fab_random_client_side_rejected` (the server-authority guard rejects a
client-side call).

The FOUP game tests run in the `lithmod:foup_default` environment:

| test | what it proves |
|---|---|
| `lithmod:foup_stack_round_trip` | the hidden rolls survive `ItemStack.copy()` and a full `ItemStack.CODEC` round trip |
| `lithmod:foup_network_view_is_public_only` | the network codec carries capacity, wafer count and lot layer only; the decoded lot has placeholder rolls |
| `lithmod:foup_encoded_size` | logs the NBT and network size of a 25 and a 64 wafer lot |
| `lithmod:foup_creative_tab_entries` | the tab hands out one empty lot per variant, each with its own lot id and the configured capacity |
| `lithmod:foup_debug_commands` | the `/debug foup` branch exists exactly when `debugCommands` is true |

## Debug commands

`/debug foup fill <count> <layer>` and `/debug foup inspect` are only registered when
`features.debugCommands` is `true` in `run/config/lithmod-local.toml`, which is off by
default. The mod asks for permission level 2 on its own nodes, but vanilla already owns
`/debug` at level 3 and brigadier keeps the existing node's requirement when two literals
with the same name merge, so the effective gate for `/debug foup ...` is level 3 in
practice. To exercise the commands in the game test run, set the key to `true` before
starting `runGameTestServer`; with the key off the same test only asserts that the branch
is absent.

## Tier data reload (manual)

Expected startup log line (one line, id, yield percent and layers):

```text
Loaded 8 tiers: T1(60%, 6 layers), T2(80%, 12 layers), ...
```

Valid override:

1. Create `run/<world>/datapacks/tier-override/data/lithmod/tiers/t3.json`.
2. Put an override such as a different `default_yield_percent`.
3. Run the dev server and execute `/reload`.
4. The server log shows the changed value in the `Loaded 8 tiers:` line.

Invalid override:

1. Add a second data pack with invalid data, for example a negative `layers` value.
2. Execute `/reload`.
3. The error names the file and field; the previous registry stays in place and
   the next `Loaded 8 tiers:` line keeps the previous values.
